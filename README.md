# Hourglass app
![](./readme/screenshot.png)

A simple app for time management.

## My productivity system

Every morning, I add all long running tasks to the app. Every task has associated duration which is a daily goal of time spent doing an activity. During the day I use timers to measure time spent on tasks. At the end of the day I can verify my assumptions.

The goal is to learn about my time spending habits and ideally be more productive doing things I actually plan to do.
